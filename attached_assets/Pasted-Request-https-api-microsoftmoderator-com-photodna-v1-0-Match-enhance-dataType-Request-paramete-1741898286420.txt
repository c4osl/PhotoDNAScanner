MatchDetails	
Collection of MatchFlags.

Source: Specifies the hash source of known image which the submitted image matched.

Violations: “A1”, “A2”, “B1” or “B2” representing the industry classification of the closest matching content as reported by the hash source provider.

MatchDistance: The squared Euclidean distance between the PhotoDNA hash of the image presented and the closest matching hash from the database. The smaller the distance, the more similar those two images are. Matches are returned for the distances equal to the match threshold or closer. This threshold was established by a large-scale test to determine the value at which there were no incorrect matches.

Note: Submitted images may match images from multiple sources.

EvaluateResponse	
Collection of image evaluation flags:

AdultClassificationScore: Numeric score representing the likelihood of adult content
IsImageAdultClassified: Boolean representing whether or not adult content was found
RacyClassificationScore: Numeric score representing the likelihood of racy content
IsImageRacyClassified: Boolean representing whether or not racy content was found
AdvancedInfo: reserved for future use
Result: Boolean representing whether or not adult and/or racy content was found
Note: this object is null unless the header 'Enable-Evaluation' is present and a valid Content Moderator key has been provided in PhotoDNA portal.
